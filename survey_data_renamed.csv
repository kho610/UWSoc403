The prevailing attitude here about the outbreak is that we are doing more harm than good by staying home because there is not a large effect here, and as a result there is a lot of people on the roads and in stores as people attempt to go about normal business. I think there is a large rift in the attitudes of the people of American society right now between people that believe that we are doing the right thing (social distancing and stay at home orders), people who believe we are doing the right thing but business NEEDS to resume, and people who do not believe we are doing the right thing. In my semi-rural area, there exists all three types of people. My grandfather does not even believe the coronavirus is as bad as people make it out to be, my other grandfather just wants to open his business, and my parents strongly believe in the stay at home order but since they both are business owners, they are itching to be done with it.",NA,NA,0,-1,1,0,0,White,0,1,US Citizen,No,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,On-campus,Parents/guardians,Two or more,Two or more,Stable and reliable,Stable and reliable,Exclusive/reliable access,Exclusive/reliable access,2020-05-11T16:54:44Z,2020-05-11,99212,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
