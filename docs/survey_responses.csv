I think there is a large rift in the attitudes of the people of American society right now between people that believe that we are doing the right thing (social distancing and stay at home orders), people who believe we are doing the right thing but business NEEDS to resume, and people who do not believe we are doing the right thing. In my semi-rural area, there exists all three types of people.

Normally I use those activities, going to a show, out for food, a bar, whatever, in order to recharge myself. Socializing and being in areas that have active people in them, whether they are talking and doing some activity or anything, is a therapeutic endeavor for me. Similar to how introverted people need their own space to themselves to recharge, I need to be able to go out and leech from others. Covid has restricted my ability to do that, and thus I have less of an energy reserve over the week. I get more exhausted from chores and simple tasks, even doing emotional labour for others will cause my energy budget or reservoir to go dry. ",tylest01@uw.edu,tylest01@uw.edu

I’m an out of state student, and from what I understand I am not getting any sort of refund or reimbursement for this quarter, which is a bit unfortunate. I’m moving back to Seattle in the fall to move into a house that my friends and I signed a lease on before all this happened, and I am really worried about paying rent and tuition when classes will be online again. I’m not going to be able to use the resources I am paying for, and I wish at least some portion of that money was refunded, but I understand why it isn’t. If this continues into winter quarter, I am going to have to seriously reevaluate my graduation plans. ",,
